# How to create and host a Minecraft server?
Minecraft is one of the most popular games worldwide. While the block-building and survival game is fun to play by yourself, it's even more fun to play with other people. Minecraft: Java Edition allows you to host your own server using your own computer. It does require some basic computer knowledge and networking skills. This will teaches you how to setup and host your own server on your computer.

**Notes and warnings:**

*- Importantly, before you try to do any of this at home, these instructions are meant for parents who are helping their kids. Thus, kids MUST get parent permission and choose a time when they can supervise and help. Setting up and running an online server means that anyone with your external IP address will be able to join your server and play in your Minecraft world. Think carefully about who you invite to play on your server!*

*- This server setup is only compatible with Minecraft: Java Edition.*

*- This guide shows you how to set up and configure a Minecraft Server. However, doing this requires changing your home network's configuration and is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. If you wish to purchase a small private server for friends, check out [Minecraft Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/realms).
