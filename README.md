# How to create and host a Minecraft server?
Minecraft is one of the most popular games worldwide. While the block-building and survival game is fun to play by yourself, it's even more fun to play with other people. Minecraft: Java Edition allows you to host your own server using your own computer. It does require some basic computer knowledge and networking skills. This will teaches you how to setup and host your own server on your computer.

### **Notes and warnings:**

> [!WARNING]
> Before you try to do any of this at home, these instructions are meant for parents who are helping their kids. Kids MUST get parent permission and choose a time when they can supervise and help. Setting up and running an online server means that anyone with your external IP address will be able to join your server and play in your Minecraft world. Think carefully about who you invite to play on your server!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide shows you how to set up and configure a Minecraft Server. However, doing this requires changing your home network's configuration and is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. If you wish to purchase a small private server for friends, check out [Minecraft Realms](<https://www.minecraft.net/realms>). If you still wish to set up your own private server, do so at your own risk.

> [!NOTE]
> This server setup is only compatible with **Minecraft: Java Edition**. This guide is only for operating platform **Windows**.

## Step by step guide

### 1. Install the Latest Version of Java
Since Minecraft is a Java-based game, our first step is to make sure you have the latest version of Java. If you don't, [download Java here](https://www.java.com/download/).

### 2. Download Minecraft_Server.jar

Next, you'll need the server files. You can get these for free from the official Minecraft site:
 
1. Go to the Minecraft Server Downloads page and download `minecraft_server.1.20.2.jar`.
2. Once the download finishes, copy `minecraft_server.1.20.2.jar` into a new folder on your desktop and call this folder "Minecraft Server" (you can name the folder however you want we just used "Minecraft Server" as an example).

> [!NOTE]
> File `minecraft_server.1.20.2.jar` can also be named `server.jar`. If this happend just reneme it or you can leave if like that. But somethink in the following steps must be changes if you leave it like that. [^1]
[^1]:When you are pasting the line into Notepad (step 3) you must change the `minecraft_server.1.20.2.jar` to the name you chosen. But leave the **.jar** in!
> [!NOTE]
> Minecraft will over time be update so the file name can be changed. I will try to update it when it changes.

### 3. Create a Batch File to Run the Server 

1. Right-click inside the Server folder where you put the `Minecraft_Server.1.20.2.jar`.
2. Select **"New"** > **"Text Document"**.
3. Name the new document **"Run"**.
4. Inside the Notepad document, paste the following line: `java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.20.2.jar nogui pause`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using a different name for the file, change `minecraft_server.1.20.2.jar` part, to the name you're using. 

5. Now **"Save As"** a batch file, which is a file Windows uses to run command line commands. 
6. Click **"File"** > **"Save As"**.
7. In the field **"Save as Type"**, select **"All Files"**.
8. Set the file name to **"Run.bat"**. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you remove the **.txt** at the end of the filename.

9. Now run the file. When you did that a batch file will open and some new files will be created. If that doesn't happend get [support above](https://github.com/GamerTilen/CreateMinecraftServer/tree/CreateMinecraftServer(main)#help--support).

### 4. Agree to the EULA

After you did the last step you will see a license agreement provided that you must agree to before launching a Minecraft server. You'll need to edit the file `eula.txt` to indicate that you agree.

1. Double-click `eula.txt`. 
2. Change the line `eula=false` to `eula=true`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can [read the EULA here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) or by copying and pasting the link from the file. 

### 5. Start the Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is NOT the finished server because you can only access it on your computer. You must do all the steps to have a server that everyone can join.

Now you're ready to start your server! 
Double-click `Run.bat` and your server will launch. 
A window will appear with some info about your server. As long as you leave this window open, your server is running!

#### The server window (server console)

Your server provides some information to help you keep track of what's going on, even if you're not in-game. 

1. You can see how much memory the server is using in the Stats panel. 
2. You can check who is currently connected to the server in the Players panel.
3. You can see server messages and player chats in the Log and Chat panel. 
4. You can use the field on the bottom-right to enter server commands.

Server Commands allow advanced users more control over their server. You can find a list of all possible commands [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands).
